{#
OPTIMIZED VERSION:
- This approach gets rid of the individual twig templates for icons.
- Use one twig template to generate any SVGs.
- Not necessary to use {% include TEMPLATE with id %} approach since property "icon" already exists to pass a specific icon template.  This could be utilized to pass icon ID instead of a template as seen in the current sample.

Requirement:
- svg file and id need to match for the simple version. --- in this case no
sprite.
- sprite can be setup with conditions.  --- Is it worth it?

Mayflower: /assets/
Drupal: /themes/custom/mass_theme/

#}
{#
NOTE: If what this template does is calls the function, it would be better to call the function in parent templates and get rid of this template.

{{ icon(icon) }}
As the final version, the function takes "icon" value, geneartes the whole icon
HTML, and prints it.
- A specific assets path for each Mayflower and Drupal is set in its unique
function.
